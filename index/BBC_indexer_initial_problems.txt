IDEAS ...
add hook to output (blue) end, 
  - well above the release gate / output channel
  - also solidifies width for release gate
remove locating lugs from baseplate, replace with removable locking tongue
  - could be slide-in from input side, like output ramp on output side
make main actuator removable
  - add horiz piece to vertical brace at outer edge of input towers
  - then cutaway with dogtooth design to make separate actuator hinge support, removable.
     - .. to suit existing shape of cutaway for carry-blocker

BIG PROBLEM
===========

(NEW)
#5 not marked w edges of rocker
mark inlet indent on baseplate
*missing* outlet-side securing hook
*missing* main actuator locating plate (15x30mm)
inlet ramp *cut off wrong parts* : make clearer
input side upstream plate : location mark for upstream tipper *not longer wanted*
needs locating mark for actuator swing end-stop
tipper horiontal rest needs raising 0.5mm to prevent blocking



Positioning of release gate 23mm up on upstream side of output
  - current position will tend to catch on the actuator arm
  - simplest fix would be to expand the size of curved output plates

Problems

Position of actuator shifted by 2-3 upslope
  - probably input ramp is short/high by 2mm : effectively, cut off ~ at edge of plates (no bad thing)

Upward end of actuator horizontal plate is cut short : needs a 3-4 mm more?
  - ALSO extend to join slanted blocking rect : cutaway underneath

P2 accidentally cut off end of actuator : PAINT connectivity ? 
LIKEWISE All the small rectangles are hard to identify

Not sure about assym spacers at btm of rocker
  - nor about the rocker parts angled edges
(?seems workable for now?)
ALSO end section could usefully be 2-3 mm longer

Joining hooks need much better chamfer : pull-in from edge, cut of corner (not shallow)

LHS plate with big hole (green) does not need the backward-sloping cutout
 - the support for the tipper likewise can be cut short


??LATER??
  lower exit ramp cutout on output (blue) much too thin
  - also matching ramp piece : lugs too frail
