IDEAS ...
add hook to output (blue) end, 
  - well above the release gate / output channel
  - also solidifies width for release gate
remove locating lugs from baseplate, replace with removable locking tongue
  - could be slide-in from input side, like output ramp on output side
make main actuator removable
  - add horiz piece to vertical brace at outer edge of input towers
  - then cutaway with dogtooth design to make separate actuator hinge support, removable.
     - .. to suit existing shape of cutaway for carry-blocker

BIG PROBLEM
===========
Positioning of release gate 23mm up on upstream side of output
  - current position will tend to catch on the actuator arm
  - simplest fix would be to expand the size of curved output plates

Problems

Position of actuator shifted by 2-3 upslope
  - probably input ramp is short/high by 2mm : effectively, cut off ~ at edge of plates (no bad thing)

Upward end of actuator horizontal plate is cut short : needs a 3-4 mm more?

P2 cut off end of actuator : PAINT connectivity ? 
LIKEWISE All the small rectangles are hard to identify

Not sure about assym spacers at btm of rocker
  - nor about the rocker parts angled edges
(?seems workable for now?)

Joining hooks need much broader chamfer

LHS plate with big hole (green) does not need the backward-sloping cutout
 - the support for the tipper likewise can be cut short

End plate needs separate one-piece design : 
  - input side needs just the big hole and slots for hooks
  - output side can be very simple : just to support lifting-gate
  - at the bottom:
    - cut off the plates with 5mm beyond the adjoining baseplate
    - add a baseplate (stuck on) sitting directly below the adjoining baseplate
    - use a couple of 5mm tongues to locate the two

??LATER??
  lower exit ramp cutout on output (blue) much too thin
  - also matching ramp piece : lugs too frail
