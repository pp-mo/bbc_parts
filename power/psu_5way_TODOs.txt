X =done  [swap in/out extents of cutouts in RH support]
. lift output ends of all dippers by 5mm
    - (i.e. and then : whole LHS)
. ALL THIN LINES
    - 0.4 is much too thick (esp red??)
    - 0.3 is ok-ish
    - 0.3 dashed, possibly neater/safer

. entry ramp needs to be higher
    - AND sloped towards output (lhs) side
    - AND add guard rails at sides
. anyway tippers *still* needed shimming ~1.5mm (thin corrugated),
    .. return < horizontal
. HOWEVER, movement now probably minimal
    - depends on drop from one pice to next
    - possibly can increase drop **OR** standoff distance of outlet releases
    .. then can (maybe) increase movement again

. spacing of outlet is too narrow

. tippers need slowing down: additional outrigger, weights ??

. outlet release edges poor
    - (already) added 5mm to lower extent : cutout edge from 10mm to 6mm
    - extend lower part of fin to be closer to cutout in 'up' position
    - (possibly) can extend cutout all the way to the edge ?
      * but then, what will support ??
